## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with name, email, and password
2. User logs in with credentials
3. JWT token is stored in localStorage
4. Protected routes check for authentication
5. User data is managed through AuthContext

---

## 🎨 Key Components

### Dashboard Components

* **Sidebar** - Navigation menu with user profile
* **TopBar** - Header with notifications and "New Referral" button
* **StatsCard** - Displays referral statistics
* **CandidateCard** - Individual candidate information card
* **SearchFilter** - Search and filter candidates
* **ActivityFeed** - Recent activity timeline
* **PerformanceMetrics** - Performance tracking

### Context Providers

* **AuthContext** - Manages authentication state and operations
* **CandidateContext** - Manages candidate data and CRUD operations

---

## 🔄 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API for:

* User authentication (login/signup)
* Fetching candidate referrals
* Adding new referrals with file upload
* Updating candidate status
* Deleting candidates

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### Protected Routes

Routes are protected using the `ProtectedRoute` component that checks for authentication before rendering.

### File Upload

Resume upload functionality supports PDF files only with validation.

### Real-time Updates

The application fetches the latest data after operations like add, update, or delete.

### Toast Notifications

User feedback is provided through toast notifications for all operations.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:

1. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**

   ```bash
   vercel deploy
   ```

The `vercel.json` configuration handles client-side routing.
